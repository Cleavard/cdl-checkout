# cdl-checkout
Shopping checkout coding task for CDL application

Developed using vscode on gitpod as a maven application
Developed on Java 17

Executed by running RcsolutionApplication.java with src/main/java

Once executed, accepts the 'help' command to view all possible commands.

Use the 'exit' tool to quit the application.

Dev notes:
Developed various unit tests using JUnit and Mockito. Sadly, executing the tests proved troublesome due to env configuration. Tests were perfromed manually.
Hopefully the tests show that I am familiar with the libraries and TDD as a concept.

I would love to discuss potential further development, as there were features I wanted to develop but I would have run out of time.
